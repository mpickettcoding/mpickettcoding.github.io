# mpickett.coding.io
This is my personal website. It was created for the final project for my Intro to Web Development (CS 410) class. It contains some of my previous work and shows what I can do as a web developer.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

This site is deployed through GitHub Pages. If you would like to visit it, click [here] (https://mpickettcoding.github.io/).
