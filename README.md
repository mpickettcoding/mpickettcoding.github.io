# About Me
This is my personal website. It was my final project for CS410: Intro to Web Development at Portland State University. It contains some of my previous work and shows what I can do as a web developer. I will continue updating it as I learn more and develop new projects.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

This site is deployed through GitHub Pages. If you would like to visit it, click [here](https://mpickettcoding.github.io/).
